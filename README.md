# BLAME
A game about hacking.

# TODO
- [x] Get basic game mechanics working.
- [x] Create a game data loading format.
- [ ] Shift away from purely password guessing, as its pretty hard to hack without knowing the exact passwords. Likely it would be better to shift to a port-cracking style of thing, like how Hacknet gameplay is.
- [ ] Refine the tutorial to make it not confusing
- [ ] Add a storyline
